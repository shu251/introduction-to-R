## Create .txt or .csv files

This is where pulling up the help menu and/or using the RStudio auto complete will help ensure you've included all the elements you need.

```{r}
#| eval: false
?write_delim()

?write.csv()

?write.table()
```


Lets practice exporting pizza in a variety of ways. Open each one up to see how it imports into Excel.

```{r}
#| eval: false
pizza
write_delim(pizza, file = "pizza-withtab-quotes.txt", delim = "\t", quote = "all")
write_delim(pizza, file = "pizza-nocols.txt", quote = "none", col_names = FALSE)
write.csv(pizza, file = "pizza-csv.csv", row.names = TRUE) # Try changing this to FALSE
```
