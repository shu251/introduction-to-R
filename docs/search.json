Additionally, we do not expect any prior experience for this course. Together, this means that each learner will have their own pace and experience during the course. Please be respectful of this and if you see how you can help someone, do so!\nFor instruction, we will be live coding the entire time. While most of the code is available on this website, the live coding aspect will help immerse you into coding in R. During each live coding session, the R script for each session will be saved and uploaded so you can access it in the future. This is because the code on this page is meant to be minimal, and during the coding sessions we will expand upon what is shown and document as we go along.\nIn order to keep a pulse on the pace of the class, please use the raising hand acknowledgement or the post it note approach to indicate to the instructor(s) that you need the content to slow down or you are stuck.\nSince we are all learning together, we will also use the term buddy up to take a pause and ask your direct neighbors for help or come together with the people around you to troubleshoot the problem.\n\n\n\nAllison Horst"

By participating in this community, participants accept to abide by The Carpentries’ Code of Conduct and accept the procedures by which any Code of Conduct incidents are resolved. Any form of behaviour to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort is a violation of the Code of Conduct. In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviours in all platforms and events:\nUse welcoming and inclusive language\nBe respectful of different viewpoints and experiences\nGracefully accept constructive criticism\nFocus on what is best for the community\nShow courtesy and respect towards other community members\nIf you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct, we ask that you report it to The Carpentries Code of Conduct Committee completing this form, who will take the appropriate action to address the situation.\nCode of Conduct (Detailed View) Part 1. Introduction\nThe Carpentries is a community-led project. We value the involvement of everyone in the community. We are committed to creating a friendly and respectful place for learning, teaching and contributing. All participants in our events and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others.\nTo make clear what is expected, everyone participating in The Carpentries activities is required to conform to the Code of Conduct. This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by The Carpentries including, but not limited to, workshops, email lists, and online forums such as GitHub, Slack and Twitter. Workshop hosts are expected to assist with the enforcement of the Code of Conduct.\nThe Carpentries Code of Conduct Committee is responsible for enforcing the Code of Conduct. It can be contacted by emailing coc@carpentries.org. All reports will be reviewed by the Code of Conduct Committee and will be kept confidential.\nPart 2. The Carpentries Code of Conduct\nThe Carpentries is dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. As such, we do not tolerate behaviour that is disrespectful to our teachers or learners or that excludes, intimidates, or causes discomfort to others. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on characteristics that include, but are not limited to, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief (or lack thereof), membership of a national minority, property, age, education, socio-economic status, technical choices, and experience level.\nEveryone who participates in Carpentries activities is required to conform to this Code of Conduct. It applies to all spaces managed by The Carpentries including, but not limited to, workshops, email lists, and online forums such as GitHub, Slack and Twitter. Workshop hosts are expected to assist with the enforcement of the Code of Conduct. By participating, participants indicate their acceptance of the procedures by which The Carpentries resolves any Code of Conduct incidents, which may include storage and processing of their personal information.\nPart 2.1 Expected behaviour\nAll participants in our events and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others. All interactions should be professional regardless of platform: either online or in-person. In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviours in all Carpentries events and platforms:\nUse welcoming and inclusive language\nBe respectful of different viewpoints and experiences\nGracefully accept constructive criticism\nFocus on what is best for the community\nShow courtesy and respect towards other community members\nNote: See the four social rules for further recommendations.\nPart 2.2 Unacceptable behaviour\nExamples of unacceptable behaviour by participants at any Carpentries event/platform include:\nwritten or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group\ncausing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation\nviolent threats or language directed against another person\nthe display of sexual or violent images\nunwelcome sexual attention\nnonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact\nsustained disruption of talks, events or communications\ninsults or put downs\nsexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes\nexcessive swearing\nincitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm\ncontinuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop\npublication of private communication without consent\nPart 2.3 Consequences of Unacceptable behaviour\nParticipants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are expected to comply immediately. This applies to any Carpentries events and platforms, either online or in-person. If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct, the organisers may warn the offender, ask them to leave the event or platform (without refund), or engage The Carpentries Code of Conduct Committee to investigate the Code of Conduct violation and impose appropriate sanctions.\nProcess Flow Diagram The diagram below illustrates the following steps in following a Code of Conduct report.\nFirst report -> assess if there is a CoC report and clear breach\nNo report or breach -> respond with an explanation to the reporter\nBreach identified -> set up a first meeting with the CoCc (Read about Incident Response Group in CoCc Governance) to collectively identify specific issues and breaches\nIf a specific breach/issue was not identified -> reply to the reporter\nIf a specific breach/issue was identified -> email the reporter/reportee as explained in CoC report handling and enforcement process\nIf it was undecided that a breach/issue occurred -> hold a meeting with the reporter/reportee as explained in CoC report handling and enforcement process -> Hold a second meeting with the CoCc to identify consequence/next steps as explained in CoC report handling and enforcement process"

Additionally, the GUI of RStudio is helpful for new learners and a great way to keep files and analyses on your computer organized.\nI’ve actually created this entire website using RStudio (and Quarto within RStudio). As an example, I also use this feature to create websites for showing preliminary data and publishing alongside articles."
