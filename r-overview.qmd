## The R computing language

1.  R is a computer programming language. The R language is leading in statistical analyses and is considered a field standard for data science.

2.  Powerful for creating figures and data exploration. I'd recommend browsing these wesites for data visualization in R: [R Graph Gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com) [top 50](http://r-statistics.co/Top50-Ggplot2-Visualizations-MasterList-R-Code.html) [ggplot ext](https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/)

3.  R is a language and users have contributed R "packages" or "libraries". These are collections of specific commands and protocols. Examples: Seabird, single-cell RNA-seq.

4.  Highly transferable skill.

## Common themes moving forward

1.  *Documentation*: have current you write notes from past you to future you

2.  *Google it*: no matter how you learned R or how advanced you are, you will ultimately be looking things up online. A part of this course will include 'how to learn R'.

3.  *Patience*: Amount of time spent may seem not useful.

## Integrationg across languages

A major pro to using RStudio, is how the new **Posit** system integrates with other computer languages (python, julia, etc.). This is ideal for projects where collaborators use a variety of R and python. Additionally, the GUI of RStudio is helpful for new learners and a great way to keep files and analyses on your computer organized.

I've actually created this entire website using RStudio (and Quarto within RStudio). As an example, I also use this feature to create websites for showing preliminary data and [publishing alongside articles](https://shu251.github.io/microeuk-amplicon-survey/).
