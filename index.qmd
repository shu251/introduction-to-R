## Course organization

This course is designed as a "crash course" that takes place only over a few days, in longer blocks of time. There will be frequent breaks. At any time raise your hand or use the 'raise hand' option remotely to ask a question.

Please note that learning R is similar to learning a whole new language. Additionally, we do not expect any prior experience for this course. Together, this means that each learner will have their own pace and experience during the course. Please be respectful of this and if you see how you can help someone, do so!

For instruction, we will be **live coding** the entire time. While most of the code is available on this website, the live coding aspect will help immerse you into coding in R. During each live coding session, the R script for each session will be saved and uploaded so you can access it in the future. This is because the code on this page is meant to be minimal, and during the coding sessions we will expand upon what is shown and document as we go along.

In order to keep a pulse on the pace of the class, please use the **raising hand acknowledgement** or the **post it note approach** to indicate to the instructor(s) that you need the content to slow down or you are stuck.

Since we are all learning together, we will also use the term **buddy up** to take a pause and ask your direct neighbors for help or come together with the people around you to troubleshoot the problem.

## Sessions archive

This course is meant to evolve over time, be re-taught, and referred to in the future. See the directory `introduction-to-R/sessions` to find the saved code from your session.

## Code of conduct

By participating in this course all participants are required to follow the [Code of Conduct].
