# R packages & libraries

Pre-packaged code and commands for you to use. Like opening a specialized program or application on your computer.

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("vegan")
library(vegan)
```

add in text about finding other R packages and show another example.


## Install tidyverse

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

## Errors and troubleshooting

1.  Read the error
2.  Google it!
3.  Typos are actually your friend


# Keeping track of your session

A part of code documentation is so that someone else can run your code later. If you have specific versions of libraries and R installed, I recommend running the command below to print out information on your R session.

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
