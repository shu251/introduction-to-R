**Mac**: For a Mac, [visit this page](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/) to download to your computer.

The most recent version is 4.2.2, please have any version over 4.0 for this course.

## Download RStudio

Above, you've installed the R programming language to your computer. If you're in a terminal, you can interact/engage R by typing "R" anywhere. This will launch R, but this is only the consol to type in code. RStudio is a user interface that makes using R more comprehensive.

[Download RStudio from posit](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

You should have RStudio version 2022.12.0.
